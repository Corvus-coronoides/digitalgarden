1d: homeomorphic to line or circle
2d: completely classified by [[genus\|genus]]
3d: there exist a unique smooth structure. geometrization project. eg. knot theory-[[Jones polynomials\|Jones polynomials]], why use surgery? geometrization?
4d: open problem. 
     eg. [[Donaldson invariant\|Donaldson invariant]], [[Seiberg-Witten\|Seiberg-Witten]] invariant
     [[categorification\|categorification]]: search for 4d TQFT that categorifies 3-manifold invariant. The BPS sector of the Hilbert space of the 4d TQFT is a cohomology group, whose Euler characteristic is the invariant.  eg. Khovanov homology & (colored) Jones polynomials/WRT invariant, similar to singular homology & Euler characteristic
     Conversely, decategorification is the [[dimensional reduction\|dimensional reduction]], where the partition function of the 4d TQFT (~Hilbert space of corresponding 3-manifold) is twisted into the invariant.

($\geq$ 5d: h-cobordism theorem and [[surgery\|surgery]] theory)
