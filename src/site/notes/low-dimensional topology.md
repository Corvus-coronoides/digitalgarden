1d: line or circle
2d: completely classified by [[genus\|genus]]
3d: there exist a unique smooth structure. geometrization project. eg. knot theory-[[Jones polynomials\|Jones polynomials]], why use surgery? geometrization?
4d: open problem. [[Donaldson invariant\|Donaldson invariant]], [[Seiberg-Witten\|Seiberg-Witten]] invariant
($\geq$ 5d: h-cobordism theorem and [[surgery\|surgery]] theory)
