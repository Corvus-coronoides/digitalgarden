1d: homeomorphic to line or circle
2d: completely classified by [[genus\|genus]]
3d: there exist a unique [[smooth structure\|smooth structure]]. geometrization project. eg. knot theory-[[Jones polynomials\|Jones polynomials]], why use surgery? geometrization?
4d: open problem. 
     eg. [[Donaldson invariant\|Donaldson invariant]], [[Seiberg-Witten\|Seiberg-Witten]] invariant, intersection forms.
($\geq$ 5d: h-cobordism theorem and [[surgery\|surgery]] theory)
