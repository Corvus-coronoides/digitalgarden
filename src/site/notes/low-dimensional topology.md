1d: homeomorphic to line or circle
2d: completely classified by [[genus\|genus]]
3d: there exist a unique smooth structure. geometrization project. eg. knot theory-[[Jones polynomials\|Jones polynomials]], why use surgery? geometrization?
4d: open problem. 
     eg. [[Donaldson invariant\|Donaldson invariant]], [[Seiberg-Witten\|Seiberg-Witten]] invariant, intersection forms.
      [[categorification\|categorification]]: The BPS sector of the Hilbert space of a TQFT gives a cohomology group, whose Euler characteristic is the invariant.  
     eg. 4d Seiberg-Witten theory and the 3d one, Khovanov homology & (colored) Jones polynomials/WRT invariant, Q-cohomology& Witten index, the same as [[singular homology\|singular homology]] & Euler characteristic
     Conversely, decategorification is the [[dimensional reduction\|dimensional reduction]], where the partition function of the TQFT gives a graded trace by compactification (periodic) and is then twisted into a homotopical invariant (when there's a $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ graded symmetry) of the corresponding 3-manifold. 
     eg. [[Witten index\|Witten index]]~periodic boundary condition, $\hat{F}$ & $\hat{H}$

($\geq$ 5d: h-cobordism theorem and [[surgery\|surgery]] theory)
