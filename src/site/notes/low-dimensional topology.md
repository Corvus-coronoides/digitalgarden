1d: line or circle
2d: completely classified by [[genus\|genus]]
3d: there exist a unique smooth structure. geometrization project. eg. knot theory-[[Jones polynomials\|Jones polynomials]], why use surgery? geometrization?
4d: open problem. eg. [[Donaldson invariant\|Donaldson invariant]], [[Seiberg-Witten\|Seiberg-Witten]] invariant
     [[categorification\|categorification]]: search for 4d TQFT that categorifies 3-manifold invariant, similar to singular homology & Euler characteristic, Khovanov homology & Jones polynomials
($\geq$ 5d: h-cobordism theorem and [[surgery\|surgery]] theory)
