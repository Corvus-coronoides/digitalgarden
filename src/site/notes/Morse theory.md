1. [[supersymmetric\|supersymmetric]] QM
     The number of the supersymmetric ground states is independent of the potential, so we can apply the limit that the strength of the potential approaches infinity, in which case ground states are localized around critical points.
 2. [[cellular homology\|cellular homology]]
     Morse fundamental theorem: Morse index=the dimension of attached cell when going across the critical point.
     Morse inequality: can be proved in SQM.
3. Morse-Bott theory, homotopy
      generalization: the Hessian matrix can be degenerated except for the normal direction, so that critical points can form a closed manifold rather than a set of discrete points.
      Applied to the proof of [[Bott periodicity\|Bott periodicity]]. (generalized Morse fundamental theorem is applied to the loop space $\Omega$ and its submanifold $\Omega^{d}$, consisting of minimal geodesics/critical points of zero indices)
