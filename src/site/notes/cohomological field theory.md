Cohomological field theory is a [[Witten type\|Witten type]] TQFT. Common examples are [[BRST quantization\|BRST quantization]] and [[CFT\|CFT]].
1. Q nilpotent: $Q^{2}=0$;
2. physical states are Q-closed ((anti-)commutator);
3. energy-momentum tensor is Q-exact;
4. vacuum is Q-closed (annihilate).

Then, in the meaning of correlators, Q-exact is s trivial insertion and correlators are independent of the metric (suppose only the action explicitly contains the metric). If we set the action be Q-exact, we can similarly prove that correlators are independent of $\hbar$. 

In 2d, correlators can be factorized w.r.t. [[genus\|genus]].
