$Dp-Dp$ open-string: Neumann directions $x_{\parallel}=x_{\parallel}(Dp)$~gauge fields, Dirichlet directions $x_\perp$~scalars; when $Dp$ ends on other branes, e.g. $NS$, $x_{\perp(NS,Dp)}(Dp)$ don't survive in the low energy [[effective action\|effective action]] (become massive? at least seems not to be a DOF:  $x_{\perp(NS,Dp)}(Dp)=x_{\perp(NS,Dp)}(NS)$ ); vector multiplet: gauge fields, one of which is compactified and becomes a scalar. 
(Sometimes, this compactified direction, e.g. $x^3$, and another direction $x^6$ are [[T-dual\|T-dual]]ized so the brane extends differently)

$NS$-brane: open strings can't end on it directly;  in $D3-D5-NS$ system, it provides bi-fundamentals and parameters: $x_{\perp(NS)}(NS)$ are FI parameters and masses of adjoint chirals ($x^3(NS)$), leading to $x^3(D3)$ safely being massive ([[Coulomb branch\|Coulomb branch]]) in the low energy.
