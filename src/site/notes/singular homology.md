The generalization of [[simplicial homology\|simplicial homology]], throwing away the triangulation (so does the notion of complex-approximation) and the gluing rules (规则相处). Relatively, [[cellular homology\|cellular homology]] seems to just loosen the gluing rules (characteristic map).

similarities: formal sum-freely generating; when preimage and image have the same dimension, close~closed loop, exact~not around holes.

Proof of equivalence: relative homology and five lemma

[[singular cohomology\|singular cohomology]]~for Abelian group, defined as cohomology of [[Eilenberg-Maclane\|Eilenberg-Maclane]] spectrum
