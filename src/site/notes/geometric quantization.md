We may have different (or even no; $\textcolor{red}{examples? Meaning\; of\;no\;quantization?}$) prequantizations, which assembles the [[phase space\|phase space]] (for gauge fields, $\textcolor{red}{the\;moduli\; space \;of \;connections?}$) a complex line bundle and map Poisson algebra (spanned by real smooth functions on the phase space) to Lie brackets.

Then, polarization is somewhat more harsh.
When the [[phase space\|phase space]] is coincidently the cotangent bundle $T^{*}M$, we can just employ the [[canonical quantization\|canonical quantization]] (real); but when it's not, such as when its volume is finite, we have to apply the [[Kahler\|Kahler]] (complex) polarization.
