A Hamiltonian is a function on the [[phase space\|phase space]]. Consider when it's $T^{*}M$. Differentiating it to get a section of $T^{*}T^{*}M$, we can map this to a vector field on $T^{*}M$ (a section of $TT^{*}M$) by the [[musical isomorphism\|musical isomorphism]] $\#$, which is called Hamilton vector field.
