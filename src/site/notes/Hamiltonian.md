A Hamiltonian is a function on the [[phase space\|phase space]]. Consider when the phase space is $T^{*}M$. Differentiating the Hamiltonian to get a section of $T^{*}T^{*}M$, we can then map it to a vector field on $T^{*}M$ (namely, a section of $TT^{*}M$) by the [[musical isomorphism\|musical isomorphism]] $\#$, which is called [[Hamilton vector field\|Hamilton vector field]] and can be integrate to the Hamilton phase flow.
