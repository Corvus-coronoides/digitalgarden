 The BPS sector of the Hilbert space of a TQFT may give a cohomology group, whose Euler characteristic is the invariant.  
     eg. 4d Seiberg-Witten theory and the 3d one, Khovanov homology & (colored) Jones polynomials, bigraded BPS Hilbert space $T[M_{3}]$ and half index $\hat{Z}_{a}(q)$ & superconformal index & WRT invariant (3-manifold, SU(2) [[Chern-Simons\|Chern-Simons]] theory), Q-cohomology& Witten index, the same as [[singular homology\|singular homology]] & Euler characteristic

Conversely, decategorification is the dimensional reduction, where the partition function of the TQFT gives a graded trace by [[compactification\|compactification]] (periodic) and is then twisted into a homotopical invariant (when there's a $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ graded symmetry) of the corresponding (n-1)-manifold boundary. 
     eg. [[Witten index\|Witten index]]~periodic boundary condition, $\hat{F}$ & $\hat{H}$
