It's an infrared [[effective theory\|effective theory]] of 4d $\mathscr{N}=2$ [[supersymmetric\|supersymmetric]] [[Yang-Mills theory\|Yang-Mills theory]]. Its [[moduli space\|moduli space]] of vacua parametrizes [[elliptic curve\|elliptic curve]]s, namely it's the fundamental domain of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$; this group is the duality group here, with the modular parameter being the coupling.


After [[topological twist\|topological twist]], we obtain a [[Witten type\|Witten type]] TQFT and can construct the [[SW invariant\|SW invariant]] on the [[moduli space\|moduli space]] of connections. This invariant relates to [[monopole\|monopole]]s and classifies the [[smooth structure\|smooth structure]] on 4d manifolds ($\textcolor{red}{why?}$).
