The phase space is a symplectic manifold. With the [[symplectic form\|symplectic form]] $\omega$, the [[Hamilton vector field\|Hamilton vector field]] can induce a 1-form (the momentum map). This process is the inverse of deriving the Hamilton vector field (Hamiltonian is itself an integral of motion).
[[Hamilton vector field\|Hamilton vector field]] can also be integrated to a phase flow, which is the [[physical motion\|physical motion]] and preserves the volume element (Liouville Theorem).
