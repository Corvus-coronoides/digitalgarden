It's a [[Schwartz type\|Schwartz type]] 2+1 d TQFT. When the base manifold is closed (so that can be a boundary), its Lagrangian can be viewed as the second [[Chern class\|Chern class]] on the bulk manifold.
The Abelian CS theory can explain the fractional quantum Hall effect ([[FQHE\|FQHE]]).
The configuration space is the [[moduli space\|moduli space]] of [[flat connection\|flat connection]]s (so that labelled by Wilson lines), whose [[geometric quantization\|geometric quantization]] needs [[Kahler polarization\|Kahler polarization]]. The expectations of [[Wilson line\|Wilson line]]s in CS theory are [[Jones polynomials\|Jones polynomials]].
Its spatial slices corresponds to [[CFT\|CFT]]. This CS/[[WZW model\|WZW model]] duality is a kind of [[AdS\CFT correspondence\|AdS\CFT correspondence]].
The path integral of Chern-Simons theory on $W$ (3d) can also be realized by that of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super [[Yang-Mills theory\|Yang-Mills theory]] on a half-space $V=W\times \mathbb{R}_{+}$, thus reduced from the [[string theory\|string theory]].

with fundamental matters (furthermore, flavors), one of its IR phases is 3d $\mathscr{N}=2$ Grassmannian [[sigma model\|sigma model]]$\rightarrow$[[Verlinde algebra\|Verlinde algebra]] of [[WZW model\|WZW model]] & [[quantum cohomology\|quantum cohomology]] of this model [[1302.2164v1] Wilson loops in supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter theories and duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2164v1)
