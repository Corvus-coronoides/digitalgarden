1. limit (of a graph in category $\mathscr{C}$)-[[final object\|final object]] of the cone category (w.r.t. the graph)-gluing (graph as well)
    eg. pullback; topological product
2. colimit/direct limit-[[initial object\|initial object]] of the cocone category-restriction
    eg. disjoint union; wedge product; stalk is the colimit of [[presheaf\|presheaf]]; for locale, the finite intersection reserves the colimit/arbitrary union; pushout 
so they both have [[universal property\|universal property]].
