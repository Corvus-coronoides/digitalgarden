limit (of a graph in category $\mathscr{C}$): [[final object\|final object]] of the cone category (w.r.t. the graph)-gluing (eg. disjoint union)
colimit/direct limit-[[initial object\|initial object]] of the cocone category-restriction (eg. stalk is the colimit of [[presheaf\|presheaf]])
so they both have [[universal property\|universal property]].
