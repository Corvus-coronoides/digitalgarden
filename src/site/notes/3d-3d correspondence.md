[[compactification\|compactification]] [[Chern-Simons\|Chern-Simons]]
Compactifying 6d (2,0) theory on $M_{3}$ gives a 3d $\mathscr{N}=2$ theory $T[M_{3};G]$, which isn't on $M_{3}$ but only depends on the topology of $M_3$ and the simply-laced Lie algebra of $G$. We have following statements:
1. $\mathscr{M}_{SUSY \; vacua}(T[M_3;G])\simeq \mathscr{M}_{flat}(M_{3};G_{\mathbb{C}})$, with the former on $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$

2. $Z_{T[M_3;G]}[L(k,1)_{b}]=Z_{CS}^{(k,\sigma)}[M_3;G_{\mathbb{C}}]$, where the left is various indices of $T[M_{3};G]$ and the right is [[WRT invariant\|WRT invariant]]. 
    eg. $L(k=0,1)=S^1\times S^2$ gives the [[superconformal index\|superconformal index]] of $T[M_3]$; when $M=S^3$, $T[M_3]$ is dual to free chiral multiplets (restrictions on base manifold of $T[M_{3}]$?); when $M=L(p,1)$, it's dual to moduli space of $N$ vortex in a $U(p)$ gauge theory $\mathscr{V}_{N,p}$

Similarly, we have 4d-2d correspondence also derived from 6d (2,0) theory.

[[categorification\|categorification]]
Then, consider $T[M_{3}]$ assigning a Hilbert space to $D^{2}$, which is bigraded and thus categorifies a certain index--the half-index. From it can we derive the superconformal index of $T[M_{3}]$ and WRT invariant on $M_{3}$. (maybe another way to describe the 3d-3d correspondence)
