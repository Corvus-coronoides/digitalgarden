$M_3 \& T[M_3]$
Compactifying 6d (2,0) theory on $M_{3}$ gives a 3d $\mathscr{N}=2$ theory $T[M_{3};G]$, which isn't on $M_{3}$ but only depends on the topology of $M_3$ and the simply-laced Lie algebra of $G$. We have following statements:
1. $\mathscr{M}_{SUSY \; vacua}(T[M_3;G])\simeq \mathscr{M}_{flat}(M_{3};G_{\mathbb{C}})$, with the former on $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$

2. $Z_{T[M_3;G]}[L(k,1)_{b}]=Z_{CS}^{(k,\sigma)}[M_3;G_{\mathbb{C}}]$.
    eg. $L(k=0,1)=S^1\times S^2$ gives the [[superconformal index\|superconformal index]] of $T[M_3]$; when $M=S^3$, $T[M_3]$ is dual to free chiral multiplets (in the sense of brane construction, $Z$-function (partition function on $S^3$) and superconformal index); when $M=L(p,1)$, it's dual to [[moduli space\|moduli space]] of $N$ vortex in a $U(p)$ gauge theory $\mathscr{V}_{N,p}$

Brane construction:
eg. $L(p,q)$: 1. Taking the [[Hopf fibration\|Hopf fibration]], reduce fivebranes on the fibre $S^1$ (Type IIA) and obtain a 3d $\mathscr{N}=2$  [[Chern-Simons\|Chern-Simons]] theory with RR flux (~level); 2. [[Dehn surgey\|Dehn surgey]]~6d (0,2) on the common boundary of the two solid torus gives 4d $\mathscr{N}=4$ SYM, which is viewed as on the "bordism" (interval of solid tori), so that its boundary conditions (boundary tori) are related by a duality/diffeomorphism consisting of S-actions and T-actions ([[Heegaard splitting\|Heegaard splitting]]). This is realized by a D3-brane (interval) stretched between two fivebranes (Type IIB).

Similarly, we have 4d-2d correspondence also derived from 6d (2,0) theory.

[[categorification\|categorification]]
Then, consider $T[M_{3}]$ assigning a Hilbert space to $D^{2}$, which is bigraded and thus categorifies a certain index--the half-index. From it can we derive the superconformal index of $T[M_{3}]$ and [[WRT invariant\|WRT invariant]] on $M_{3}$. (maybe another way to describe the 3d-3d correspondence: invariant on $M_3 \& T[M_3]$)
