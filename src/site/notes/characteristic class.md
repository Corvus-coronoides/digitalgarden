definition:
1. pullbacks of characteristic classes on [[universal bundle\|universal bundle]]
2. axiom
3. [[topological obstruction\|topological obstruction]] theory

eg. Chern class
Chern-Weil homomorphism: $H^{2}(M,\mathbb{Z})\rightarrow H^{2}(M,\mathbb{R})$
[[intersection\|intersection]] theory: $c_{1}$ can be viewed as pullback of Thom form via a zero section
The first [[Chern class\|Chern class]] is the curvature.
