The lifting is classified by the second [[Cech cohomology\|Cech cohomology]] group of the Lie group/algebra: $G\times G\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, where $\mathbb{C}$ actually can be replaced by other centers of $G$.

eg1. In [[CFT\|CFT]], the Witt algebra has $\mathbb{C}$ knids of different extensions, but among them $\mathbb{C}/\{0\}$ give algebras isomorphic to the Virasoro algebra. [如何寻找共形场论中的中心扩张和中心荷？ - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/517500343/answer/2356237920)
eg2. For [[orbifolds\|orbifolds]], the [[discrete torsion\|discrete torsion]] is very similar. But I don't know whether the lifting is also similar to the above. ([Note on Orbifolds and Discrete Torsion - 知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/618814414))
